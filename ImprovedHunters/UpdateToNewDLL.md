# Updating Improved Hunters for a new CrusaderDE.dll

## Audited baseline

- Steam build ID: `24651686`
- DLL size: `3450880` bytes
- SHA-256: `33AA33457F7DFAAA6D316D1D5E4C5AB97094F2C73B68D349990ABF9D0EF3B469`

The mod is strictly hash-gated because it uses raw unit layouts. On the audited
hash, it validates each pattern only at its direct RVA and does not scan the
DLL. Every other DLL leaves the complete runtime inactive.

## Native address map

| Source pattern | Reference RVA | Use / offset |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `CamelDespawnTickTimePattern` | `0x158468` | signed immediate at `+13` |
| `ChickenDespawnTickTimePattern` | `0x163415` | signed immediate at `+13` |
| `TargetSelectionTypeDispatchPattern` | `0x18F262` | automatic target type dispatch |

The source constants contain the complete wildcard patterns.

The automatic target selector starts at RVA `0x18E950`. A valid explicit
`TribeAICommand.AttackUnit` is checked at RVA `0x18EAE6` and assigns its target
at RVA `0x18ED46`, before the automatic candidate type dispatch.

The dispatch target table is at RVA `0x18F9C4`, and the type-to-dispatch-index
table is at RVA `0x18F9E0`. Chicken type `62` has table index `62 - 44 = 18`,
so its byte is at RVA `0x18F9F2`. Vanilla value `6` routes to the general
acceptance case at RVA `0x18F3A6`. Improved Hunters temporarily writes value
`0`, which routes to RVA `0x18F28E`; that case accepts only attacker type `6`
(hunter) and otherwise rejects the candidate at RVA `0x18F754`.

## Required update audit

1. Require one semantic match for both despawn patterns and verify that operand 1 at
   pattern offset `13` remains the signed 16-bit despawn duration.
2. Revalidate both automatic target dispatch tables, the chicken entry, the
   hunter-only acceptance/rejection branches and that explicit `AttackUnit`
   target assignment still occurs before automatic candidate dispatch.
3. Revalidate the Script Extender unit array and raw fields `+0x88`, `+0x92`,
   `+0x94`, `+0xC0`, `+0xC2`, `+0x29C`, `+0x2BC`, `+0x2C4`, `+0x370`,
   `+0x39A`, `+0x39C` and `+0x448`.
4. Confirm hunter/prey states, corpse flag, death timer, reservations, target
   IDs, coordinates, camel health and visual health refresh behavior.
5. Test automatic ranged rejection, explicit ranged `AttackUnit`, hunter
   retargeting, projectile compensation, corpse cleanup, camel health and
   chicken neutralization on fresh and loaded maps.
6. Update all three reference RVAs and the dispatch-table map before approving
   the new shared hash.

## Audit for Steam build 24651686

Both complete patterns match exactly once. Their signed 16-bit immediate still
starts at pattern offset `13`; the surrounding animal state remains `0x6E` and
the death-timer field remains `+0x986` in the native manager-relative form.
The automatic target pattern also matches exactly once. Its encoded table RVAs
remain `0x18F9E0` and `0x18F9C4`; chicken entry `0x18F9F2` is `6`, dispatch
entries `0` and `6` remain `0x18F28E` and `0x18F3A6`, and the hunter-only case
still rejects non-hunters at `0x18F754`. Explicit `AttackUnit` still assigns its
target before the automatic dispatch.
The Script Extender initialized the same `0x490`-byte unit records, and targeted
native accesses reconfirmed the raw field map used by the runtime. Fresh/load
map behavior remains a post-build game smoke test.
