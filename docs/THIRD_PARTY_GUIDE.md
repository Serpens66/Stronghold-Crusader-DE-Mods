# Third-party integration guide

## Initialization and ownership

Use your plugin's stable GUID for `ApiShared.ForMod`. Keep the resulting client, logger, settings and callbacks in a static runtime or a long-lived publisher. Register managed lifecycle services from `Awake`, after the hard APIShared dependency has initialized. Acquire native services in `WhenReady`. Never treat a native failure as proof that all managed services failed.

The example library compiles against ordinary public assemblies and has no `InternalsVisibleTo` access. Build it with the game path supplied through `GameDir`; its APIShared reference defaults to this repository's output for verification and can be overridden with `ApiSharedDir` for normal installed use. APIShared's build driver compiles it as a consumer check, but does not install it into the game.

## Optional game-mode permissions

Read `MissionLifecycleNotification.Context.Mode` for the event being handled. Use `GameModeHelper.Capture()` for a current snapshot where appropriate. Capture itself applies no permissions. Construct `GameplayModActivationProfile` with your own GUID, allowed contexts and `allowRealMultiplayer`, then call `GameplayModModePolicy.IsAllowed`. You can instead implement your own policy directly from the snapshot.

The built-in optional evaluator rejects unknown or conflicting origins. Its existing contexts do not offer a tutorial permission. These defaults do not prevent a third-party mod from making its own informed policy decision without the evaluator. Do not call `SerpsModProfiles.GetProfile` for a foreign GUID; those profiles deliberately describe our established mods only.

## Presets without SerpsModsHost

Derive your settings from `APIShared.ModSettings.PresetLobbyModSettingsViewModel` and register through `LobbyModSettingsPresetRegistration.Register`. The Script Extender displays the mod tab; APIShared owns discovery, personal preset files, persistence and lobby convergence. SerpsModsHost and ExtendedData are optional consumers, not prerequisites.

Classify saved properties with Script Extender `[SyncHostOnly]` or `[SyncPerPlayer]`, or APIShared `[PresetLocal]`. Each per-player property needs a public compatible `<Name>Data` array for slots 0..8. Keep setters behind `CanMutateSetting()` and call `OnPropertyChanged` after actual changes. Configure additional per-player rules through `ConfigurePerPlayerLobbySettings`; do not implement another roster poller.

Bind host/client UI sections to `CanEditHostSettings` and `CanEditClientSettings`. Bind common preset/source actions to the public `System_*` properties and commands; do not replace them with a second persistence engine. Use nonempty tooltips with `ToolTipService.ShowDuration="60000"`. Settings-search metadata is optional when the control title/tooltip layout is unambiguous.

The example includes a minimal host/local settings tab. Use localized labels and override `ResolveSettingsUiText` for translated common actions in a production mod. APIShared supplies English fallbacks. Shared file formats and legacy `__Serp*` persistence keys are retained for existing saves; they do not restrict mod GUIDs or require the Serps pack.

## Migration and packaging

Older APIShared releases exposed settings and mode types under `Shared`. When updating such a consumer, use `APIShared.ModSettings` and `APIShared.GameModes`, update its XAML namespace imports, and rebuild against the selected APIShared release. Serps-specific profiles are under `APIShared.SerpsMods`; unrelated mods construct their own profiles. The command/formation implementation remains internal.

Release consumers with hard minimum APIShared/Script Extender versions and `<Private>false</Private>` for runtime references. Never include APIShared.dll, Script Extender DLLs or game DLLs in the consumer package. Put your XAML under the usual mod Override directory. Keep one centrally installed APIShared instance.
